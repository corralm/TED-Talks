# TED Talks
Sex, politics, and religion are three of the main of taboo topics that we don’t usually talk about. Yet, they are very important concepts.

So, why "can't" we talk about them?

Politics & Religion – People tend to have passionate beliefs which can lead to strong disagreements and emotionally charged discussions.
Sex – Can lead to potential legal implications depending on the context.

Since we can't seem talk abou these topics, I turned to TED to see what the experts had to say to better understand this issue.
